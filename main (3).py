"""Implement a class called Player that represents a cricket player. The Player class should have a 
method called play() which prints "The player is playing cricket. Derive two classes, Batsman and 
Bowler, from the Player class. Override the play() method in each derived class to print "The batsman 
is batting" and "The bowler is bowling", respectively. Write a program to create objects of both the
Batsman and Bowler classes and call the play() method for each object."""


# define a base class player
